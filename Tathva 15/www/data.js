Be it SatyaNadella of Microsoft or SunderPichai of Google, there’s no exception of exemplary management skills when it comes to being in the top management of any concern. Here’s your chance to show us that you’re the best of the best when it comes to management. Welcome aboard!</p><h2>SPECIFICATIONS </h2><p>Round 1:<br><br>You need to prove it before the crowd that you know more about the business realm than anyone in town, don’t you? Here’s our way of testing how much of a biz wiz you are! This round will have a quiver of arrows shot at you which can be dodged if your knowledge of the business arena is sound enough. C’mon! Get ready to show us what you’ve got.This will be an elimination round and the number of contestants that qualify to the next round will hold a ratio with the total number of contestants.<br><br>Round 2:<br><br>Not everyone can perform good with a team of strangers: or at least, so we believe and we want you to market the team player in you by participating in a team activity which is going to be much more fun than the first round.Before you generalize, let’s make it clear: No! It’s NOT a clichéd round of Group Discussion. It’s going to be quite a challenging round with an activity that you’ll love to do as a team while providing you a shot at making friends out of strangers before you walk out of our glorious NITC!Remember that event organized at your college where you effectively managed the finance? Hold on to that achievement! All that you learned then by doing your best or worst is going to lend helping hands here. You’ll be given a hypothetical situation of managing a crisis related to one or a few aspects of management and how you perform and get along with the other contestants will decide your advancement to the next round.This round won’t keep you engaged for long. 30 minutes will be what you need and it’s our duty to ensure that those are the best 30 minutes you’ve had in a while!<br><br>Round 3:<br><br>What’s a management event without a marketing round? We know that your skills aren’t just limited to answering quizzes and solving crises. You might have to write CTCs, captions, prepare flyers to advertise and even write a promotion strategy for the product you’re given! It doesn’t really matter if you do or don’t speak Shakespearean but remember, ‘Brevity is the soul of the wit.’ And don’t worry you’ll have a couple of hours to do them all. And while you’re at it, you can pick some time out of it to check out other cool stuff in the campus too!<br><br>Final Round:<br><br>You might have a lot of reasons to get stressed and a whole lot of ways to relieve yourselves off your stresses. Espresso, Chai, Chocolates, you name it! But here’s how we get to know how much of stress can be harnessed by you! This will be a typical stress interview with the interviewers trying to petrify you! But as long as you’ve your mug of espresso beside you, worry not! You’re gonna be fine! On top of that, you stand the chance of being crowned the winner!</p><h2>CONTACT </h2><ul><p>AISHWARYA NAIR : 7560804080</p><p>NITHIL P P : 9995223505</p><p>POONGUNTAN CIBI J U : 9944736208</p>"

            "Content": "<h2>AQUA STRIKE</h2><h3>Incredible performance for powerful apps</h3><p>Water rockets have been a source of entertainment and education for many years. They are usually made with an empty two-litre plastic soda bottle by adding water and pressurizing it with air for launching. This is an event where a team has to demonstrate the performance of their water rocket.</p><h2>TEAM SPECIFICATIONS</h2><p>• A maximum of three members are allowed per team.<br>• Team members have to produce valid ID card of the institute.<br>• There can be students from different educational institutes in a single team.</p><h2>DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS</h2><p>• It must be a single stage water rocket. Multiple stages are not allowed.<br>• The rocket body should be made only with plastic bottles of aerated soft drinks of maximum capacity 2.25L and should be free of any fabrication failures or dents caused by heat exposure.<br>• The water rocket must use only compressed atmospheric air as its source of energy. Pressure compressors (foot pump) shall be provided at the venue. The pressure inside the container (rocket body) before launch should not exceed 60 psi for the first two rounds.<br>• Water to be filled in the rockets will be provided by the organizers. The amount of water to be used is left to the choice of the team.<br>• Each team must have their own launchers. No two/more teams can use a same launcher.<br>• The rocket must be launched from a stationary position using a fixed launcher. Slingshots, trebuchets, catapults, cannons, and all other forms of launcher boost assists are strictly forbidden. In other words, the internal pressure of the rocket must be the only source of energy for the rocket.<br><br>The team will be disqualified if<br>o The rocket blasts before launch.<br>o The rocket is found dangerous to launch by the organizers.<br>o Any part breaks off from the rocket during flight.</p><h2>EVENT LAYOUT</h2><p>There will be 3 rounds. The three rounds will be testing the capability as better missile designers.<br>ROUND 1: RANGE TEST<br>The missiles are being tested for maximum range. The testing site will be a rectangular ground. Tentative test site is being shown. Each team will be asked to launch their missiles from one of the two launching stations. The missile must land inside the rectangular box(between lines A&B in case of 150+). The missiles are then graded into 50+,60+,...,140+,150+ according to the range they cover. Deviations are not being taken into account for scoring. The top 10 teams will be chosen for the next round. Each team will have 2 chances to try out this test and the best of the 2 will be chosen for score. TOP 10 will be chosen for the next round. Maximum points that can be scored in this round are 90.<br>ROUND 2: ACCURACY TEST<br>Here each team will be asked to launch the missiles onto a specific target. There will be 3 targets at different ranges .Teams have to hit on any of the three according to their choice. The targets will be at 50m,70m and 90m all having 3 concentric circles of diameters 6m, 4m and 2m respectively. There will be 2 chances for each team in this round and the points are added up; thereby making the maximum points attainable in this round 60*2=120. The teams will be ranked based on the total of their final scores in Round 1 and Round 2. TOP 3 will be selected for the final round.<br>ROUND 3: PRECISION TEST<br>In this round a team's precision is evaluated by allowing their rockets to fire at five different circles at different distances with different circle diameters from a fixed single launching point. The targets will be at a distance of 25m, 35m, 50m, 70m, 90m, and the diameter of circles at each target is 2m, 3m, 4m, 5m, 6m respectively. However the teams have to launch the rockets on to the targets in a fixed random order for all the teams who have been qualified for the final round.( For example, the random order of targets can be target 3, target 5, target 2, target 1, target 4). The random order and the point distribution will be announced to the participants by the event managers before the start of final round.</p><h2>SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS</h2><p>• All the teams getting selected to final round (Top 3 in round1+round2) are assured cash prize.<br>• Team numbers will be assigned to the teams prior to the event . Team numbers will be written onto the rockets using a permanent marker.<br>• First two rounds will be conducted on 1st day, and the final round will be on the second day.<br>• For the final round teams may/may not bring their ready made rockets. Teams have a night to build their rockets. Few bottles can be provided if asked. Other common items like tapes, adhesives etc are available in the nearby shops.<br>• Team members must clear any doubts related to the final round before its start.<br>• Final round being new may be altered in its structure/cancelled during the course of the event for matching time, safety, space or any other constraints.<br>• In the event of a dispute event managers will be making impartial decisions.All the decisions made collectively by the event managers will be final.</p><h2>CONTACT</h2><ul><p>Chaitanya ERK : 7736269340</p><p>V.V.S Raghunadh Billa : 9567036286</p><p>Chukka venu madhava : 7736875548</p></ul>",
